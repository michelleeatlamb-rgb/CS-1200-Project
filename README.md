# StudyHelper

A small React + Vite study helper prototype with:

- Homepage with navigation
- Dashboard
- Summaries page
- Notes page
- Quizzes page
- Community page
- Explore page
- Profile page
- Simple admin pages

This is a **front-end only** mock. There is no real backend or real AI — everything is local and fake data.
